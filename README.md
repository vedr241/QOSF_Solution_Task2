# QOSF_Solution_Task2

I got help from the following public materials in the internet. 
1. https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier.html
2. https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/929/attachments/3968/4559/piotr_gawron_quantum_neural_networks.pdf
First two help in variational classifier in pennylane and getting score of binary classification.

Encoding in Pennylane from below article is very useful.
