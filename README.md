# QOSF_Solution_Task2

I got help from the following public materials in the internet. 
1. https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier.html
2. https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/929/attachments/3968/4559/piotr_gawron_quantum_neural_networks.pdf

First two materials helps in variational classifier implemented in pennylane and getting scores (accuracy and confusion matrix) of binary classification model.

Encoding in Pennylane from below article is very useful.
